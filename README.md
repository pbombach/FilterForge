Filter Forge
=====

This app will allow a user to apply a filter to an input image and see how the filter's parameters affect the output. The purpose of it is threefold:
* Serve as a vehicle to teach me Core Image programming
* Serve as a limited electronic light table analysis tool
* Serve as a springboard which will allow me to explore image processing in the Core Image space.

Bear in mind if you are using this app, it is extremely unstable. I frequently make checkpoint commits and push them to github in order to facilitate transfer between my machines. Caveat Emptor.
