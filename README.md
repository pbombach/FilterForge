Filter Forge
=====

This app will allow a user to apply a filter to an input image and see how the filter's parameters affect the output. The purpose of it is threefold:
* Serve as a vehicle to teach me Core Image programming
* Serve as a limited electronic light table analysis tool
* Serve as a springboard which will allow me to explore image processing in the Core Image space.

I welcome any comments and suggestions. In addition, please feel to use it if you find it useful. Due to the frequency of my 
checkpoint commits, an elephant balanced on a needle would seem extraordinarily stable in comparison. This is a work very much
in progress. Bear this in mind. Caveat Emptor.
